This project began in November 2017 with the simple goal of self learning front-end web design. I quickly realized the need for JavaScript, and server side languages and database applications (PHP and MySQL). I struggled with WebPack for a while, then eventually ran into React. Now the goal is continue expanding the horizon, utilize modern frameworks and libraries, and inevitably land a career as a full-stack, SPA developer.
