        <b>Information Collection, Use, and Sharing</b>
        <br />
        We are the sole owners of the information collected on this site. We
        only have access to/collect information that you voluntarily give us via
        email or other direct contact from you. We will not sell or rent this
        information to anyone.
        <br />
        We will use your information to respond to you, regarding the reason you
        contacted us. We will not share your information with any third party
        outside of our organization, other than as necessary to fulfill your
        request, e.g. to ship an order.
        <br />
        Unless you ask us not to, we may contact you via email in the future to
        tell you about specials, new products or services, or changes to this
        privacy policy.

        <b>Security</b>
        <br />
        We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit
        sensitive information via the website, your information is protected
        both online and offline.
        <br />
        Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data),
        that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You
        can verify this by looking for a lock icon in the address bar and
        looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the webpage.
        <br />
        While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted
        online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who
        need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or
        customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable
        information. The computers/servers in which we store personally
        identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
        <br />
        If you feel that we are not abiding by this privacy policy, you should
        contact us immediately.

        <b>Cookies</b>
        <br />
        We use "cookies" on this site. A cookie is a piece of data stored on a
        site visitor's hard drive to help us improve your access to our site and
        identify repeat visitors to our site. For instance, when we use a cookie
        to identify you, you would not have to log in a password more than once,
        thereby saving time while on our site. Cookies can also enable us to
        track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on

        <b>Sharing</b>
        <br />
        We share aggregated demographic information with our partners and
        advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can
        identify any individual person.
        <br />
        We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card
        processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies
        do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information
        for any secondary purposes beyond filling your order.
        <br />
        We partner with another party to provide specific services. When the
        user signs up for these services, we will share names, or other contact
        information that is necessary for the third party to provide these
        services. These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable
        information except for the purpose of providing these services.
